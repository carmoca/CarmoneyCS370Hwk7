SUNYIT CS370 Homework 7 Assignment - Option 3

This project was created and built using Google's ADT.

Be warned.  When you check this project out and import it into eclipse,
eclipse does this cleaver little thing where it wipes the AndroidManifest.xml
file clean - as well as a few others.

Now, on my system I simply copied the contents of AndroidManifest.xml into the (now)
empty AndroidManifest.xml file, saved it, reopened eclipse and that seemed to make it happy.

YMMV.
